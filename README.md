# AL-FrontEndWeb-Dev-Project
Project #4


This project utilizes the chuck norris API https://api.chucknorris.io/ 

On page load , a random quote is generated, explicit content is sometimes seen 

The `home` page links to a sub-html page https://anickacodes.github.io/AL-FrontEndWeb-Dev-Project/2nd%20Folder/index.html , a `hover` feature is seen on both links 

The `home` page includes a linked css file ; the sub-html page is styled inside the html 

 ... this is in progress
