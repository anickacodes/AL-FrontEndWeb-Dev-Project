# AL-FrontEndWeb-Dev-Project
Project #4

## Hello & Welcome to my Mod 2 Final Project 

This project showcases front-end and back-end optimization
There is a deployed front-end application.
Users can interact through button clicks and form inputs.
Users can make requests to an external API via formr submission
Users can contact the author via at least email via home page
There is a theme and unique product design.

This project utilizes the chuck norris API 
>https://api.chucknorris.io/ 
as well as 
>https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/categories 

The `home` page links to a `sub-html` page 
>https://anickacodes.github.io/AL-FrontEndWeb-Dev-Project/2nd%20Folder/index.html  


*Requirements*

On page load , an advisory warning is seen && a random quote is generated

A `hover` feature is seen on both links 

The `home index.html` page includes a linked `css` file ; the `sub-html` page is styled `inside` the html

CSS Grid is used on the `sub-html` in the footer while the `home` page utilizes different `flex` methods

Both pages have `visual changes` that occur when the screen is a different size


*STRETCH GOALS* 

-css transition appears on home page load 
-found a free API with no fetch struggles 

**Final Notes**

I enjoyed this project, despite the many setbacks ranging from trying to find a useable API to scratching my original plan to upgrade my Inventory Web Project
>https://github.com/anickacodes/AL-Inventory-Web-Application 

I sharpened my front and back-end skills in terms of formatting css boxes, creating cleaner code, pacing myself, utilizing all my available resources - including trello (which I am still uneasy about)
